<p>This app shows how the cumulative proportion of successes changes in a
binomial experiment.  Each trial has one of two outcomes:
&ldquo;success&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the success probability for your experiment in the grey box.</li>
<li>Clicking the Simulate button will run the specified number of trials of
your experiment and append the outcomes to the results list on the far
right.</li>
<li>A graph of the cumulative proportion of successes achieved after each
trial is plotted in the middle with a <span class='mean'>horizontal
line</span> that corresponds with the success probability.</li>
<li>Unchecking the Animate box will display the simulation results for all
trials immediately instead of updating the graph after each trial.</li>
</ul>
