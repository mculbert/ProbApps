<li>Create a set of points clustered together for which the
<span class='mean'>mean</span> and the
<span class='median'>median</span> are very close.</li>

<li>Create two separate clusters of points for which the 
<span class='mean'>mean</span> and the
<span class='median'>median</span> are very close.</li>

<li>Create a set of points for which the
<span class='mean'>mean</span> is <b>greater</b> than the
<span class='median'>median</span>.
How can you change the data so that the
<span class='mean'>mean</span> is <b>less</b> than the
<span class='median'>median</span>?</li>

<li>Create a set of points that are clustered together. What happens to the
<span class='mean'>mean</span> and the
<span class='median'>median</span> when you add a point that is far away?</li>

<li>Create a set of points that are clustered together. What happens to the
<span class='stdev'>standard deviation</span> and the
<span class='quartile'>interquartile range</span> when you add a point that
is far away?</li>

<li>Remove the maximum point and add a new point that is much larger. What
happens to the <span class='median'>median</span>?</li>
