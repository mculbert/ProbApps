<h2>Explorations</h2>
<ul>

<li>Choose a random experiment with two possible outcomes. For example:
    <ul>
    <li>Flipping a fair coin (p = .5).</li>
    <li>Rolling a 1 on a 6-sided die (p = .1666).</li>
    <li>Rolling a 2 or a 4 on a 6-sided die (p = .3333).</li>
    <li>Rolling an 8 with two 6-sided dice (p = .1388).</li>
    <li>Tossing loaded dice (say p = .7).</li>
    <li>Drawing a face card from a poker deck (p = .2308).</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Choose 100 trials and run the simulation several times, clicking Reset
after each run. How much variability is there in the cumulative proportion
early in the experiment (small trial number)? How much variability is there
in the cumulative proportion late in the experiment (large trial
number)?</li>

<li>As the length of the experiment increases, what number is the cumulative
proportion approaching?</li>

<li>Set the success probability to .5 and run the simulation with 100
trials. Look through the list of outcomes. How often do you notice 5 or more
consecutive successes or failures?</li>
